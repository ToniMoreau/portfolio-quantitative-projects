## About

This repository gathers independent mathematical projects developed alongside my undergraduate studies in mathematics.

The objective of this work is to deepen my understanding of:

- Probability theory  
- Statistical inference  
- Stochastic processes  
- Numerical methods for stochastic modeling  

Each project combines:
- Theoretical background
- Mathematical derivations when relevant
- Numerical implementation
- Critical discussion of results

The work presented here reflects a structured and rigorous approach to applied mathematics beyond standard coursework.
